# GRAFFLE


## A Modular Type Safe GraphQL Client for JavaScript.

### Exploring Advanced Type Level techniques

<!--
- Hey everyone
- I'm here today to talk about building a modular type safe GraphQL client library
- Thanks to the Meetup organizers for having me as a speaker and to all of you for showing up today

<!--
- First off a bit about me
- My name is Jason, I'm a Montreal-based developer with over 10 years experience
- I studied in design but through open-source gateway drugs like Wordpress, jQuery, Node, GitHub, etc. I found my way into this world of systems building
- I've worked on web apps, cloud services, automation, devops, architecture, libraries, etc.
- Some places I've worked at include Prisma, Dialogue, littleBits and in a few weeks I'm joining The Guild.
- I also work as an open source maintainer on various libraries
- And for the past five years especially I've worked extensively with TypeScript
- Since leaving Prisma this year I've focused my work on a new GraphQL client library called Graffle which is the basis for this talk today.

# Plan

45 minutes

<toc></toc>

<!--
- Ok, so let's get started
- I'm going to briefly introduce Graffle
- Then we'll spend most of the time diving into implementation details of various features that have advanced type level logic
- Feel free to ask questions at any time if something isn't clear to you
